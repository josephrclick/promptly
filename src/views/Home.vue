            v1.0.6 - I built this app from scratch over a weekend using ChatGPT. I write code for fun sometimes and this would have taken me weeks of work on my own to figure out. Instead, it's like I guided an expert coder and watched over its shoulder the whole time and I learned a ton.

            I've probably talked with you recently about all this, which is why you're reading this right now. Maybe you've never asked ChatGPT a question. Maybe you have zero idea what any of this is. Maybe you've heard the buzz but like what's the big deal...
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The big deal may not be obvious at first, but if you spend some time talking with ChatGPT, ideas will start to pop up and you'll explore more and more. I bet you'll be constantly impressed by what these AI models can do and you will find neat ways to use them in your life.
