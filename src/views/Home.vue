            I built this app casually over a weekend using ChatGPT. From scratch. By having a conversation.

            We all need to be learning how to leverage this technology as much as possible, right now. We can still be early to this party and ride the massive wave that's coming in.

          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            My intent is to get you over any reluctance or skepticism of AI you may have and get you to have (possibly?) your first chat with ChatGPT <b>right now</b>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I wanted to also provide some curated learning content as a kind of crash course to get you up to speed on the basics and to start using ChatGPT.
