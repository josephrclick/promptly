            I built this app casually over a weekend using ChatGPT.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            I've been telling everyone we all need to learn the skills right now to benefit from the AI tech revolution taking place, so I thought I'd see if I could build something like a mobile app to help my friends and family get up to speed with the technology.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            My intent is to get you to have (possibly?) your first chat with ChatGPT <b>right now</b>, provide some curated learning content, and share some neat examples of how to get value from the tool.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Maybe I'll keep working and build out the other features on the app but for now it's a minimum viable product that was just neat to work on.
          </p>
